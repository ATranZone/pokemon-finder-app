# PokéFinder App

Welcome to the PokéFinder App! This app allows users to search for Pokémon by their name or ID number. Get detailed information about your favorite Pokémon at your fingertips!

## Features

- **Search by Name or ID**: Type the name or ID number of any Pokémon in the search bar.
- **Detailed Information**: When you submit a search, the app returns essential details about the Pokémon, including:
  - Name
  - Types
  - Height
  - Weight
- **User-Friendly Experience**: If the Pokémon is not found, the app will display a message: "Pokemon not found, try its ID number instead."

  **Note**: Some Pokémon can not be searched for by their traditional names. For example, searching for "Giratina" will return nothing, but entering its ID number (487) will return "Giratina-Altered."

## How to Use

1. **Input**: Enter the Pokémon's name or ID number in the search bar.
2. **Submit**: Click the search button or press Enter to submit your query.
3. **View Results**: If the Pokémon is found, details will be displayed. If not, a friendly message will guide you to try again.
